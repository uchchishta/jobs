LibreOffice plans the next major release of version 6.0. In order to have a unique design we want to updated the branding, which is basically the splash screen, the installer on Windows, the about dialog, and some banners/flyers/stickers outside the program. The task is to design a new motif that conveys the metaphors:
* Transparency, Sustainability, Freedom
* Community
with the additional ideas of
* MUFFIN (https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2016/12/21/the-document-foundation-announces-the-muffin-a-new-tasty-user-interface-concept-for-libreoffice/)
* Green
* Hexagon
* Circular (https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/User:Chin_Zee_Yuen)

The design has to follow the restrictions of colors and the general identification as stated at https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Marketing/Branding. The font "Vegur" has been selected for the use within the LibreOffice logo and accompanying text. The design concept must work globally. We want to include the community into the process and run a survey with some different proposals. Therefore the job should be finished until end of July 2017.

In a first internal poll the big digit "5" in the current design was criticized (http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Branding-for-LibreOffice-6-0-tt4210681.html).
